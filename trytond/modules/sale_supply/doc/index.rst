Sale Supply Module
##################

The Sale Supply module adds a supply on sale option on product.
If checked, it will generate a purchase request for each sale lines of this
product regardless of the stock levels. At the confirmation of the purchase,
the customer shipments are created. Once the purchased products are received
then the products on the customer shipments are assigned.
